No WiFi Calling
Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2021
Style: A12Color: BlackVerified Purchase
I researched before I purchased, having found that Samsung phones supported Wifi calling - although not listed in the product description of this particular phone. Well, I wish I could remember what sight that info was on, because it's the farthest thing from the truth! I even went into the At&T Store and asked which models support it --- they didn't even have any..... I ended up finding a Google Pixel 3 - which per Amazon's "Ask and Answer" was reported to have supported WiFi calling. I work from home, in my basement..... and access to WiFi calling is essential. I can't believe how hard it was to find a new cell phone with this feature. I am thankful that Amazon has an amazing return policy - as this phone and the case I purchased are headed back.

It is not unlocked.
Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2021
Style: A12Color: BlackVerified Purchase
Very nice phone, sleep and stylish. Would have given it a 4 stars if it was as described. Purchased this phone because it says unlocked. Traveled overseas with it and could not use it. Even it says unlocked it was not.

Locked
Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2021
Style: A12Color: BlackVerified Purchase
Bought the phone to go with Mint mobile. Phone was locked! Phone would not recognized SIM cards. Called customer service they are sending me a new phone. I will update when it arrives.

Update 7/17/2021: received replacement phone. After multi calls to Mint mobile determined this phone was also locked. I called Amazon customer service and informed them of the situation. They said they would escalate with the distributor and pull the phones. Hopefully, it was just bad luck on my part. Returned product.
I do give 5 stars for Amazon's customer service.

The quality of the pictures with this phone is awful! It reminds me to my very old phone from 2005. The phone only looks modern but in reality is just and old device

Frustrated by camera
Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2021
Style: A12Color: BlackVerified Purchase
Camera error notice keeps coming up. No fix. Can't switch lens or take pics quicky. Unable to take pics at my 40 year reunion weekend. Visited SAMSUNG store-they claimed they have never seen this issue, so I did a Google search with them to show the long list of similar complaints with no fix. IT sucks to borrow an iPhone to take a basic picture. FIX or REPLACE
