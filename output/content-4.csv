Lots of Little Issues & glitches that I am fairly convinced is the Phone
Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
It came very quickly and I would say I'm about 70% happy with it. It does seem to have some glitches and doesn't seem to connect quite as well as my last phone. I'm not sure what to think and again because overall it works pretty well and I'm not a Diva I will probably tolerate the glitches for all the other things it does well.

Hemos quedados muy satisfechos con este celular que era un regalo especial para una niña que cumplia 12 años y ha sido perfecto para ella. Llego en perfecta condición y llegó el día tal como lo dijeron. Es maravilloso poder contar con Amazon y poder confiar en ellos. Muchísimas Gracias.
