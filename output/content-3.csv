It's just OK

Coming from a pixel 2 I expected more.
Front camera is slow and very blurry in low-light
vibration intensity is pathetic, I keep missing calls.
it's obnoxiously large
fingerprint scanner is inconsistent at best, even without any screen protection (if anyone had one in stock)
Samsung's version of android is garbage, I actually downgraded from Android 11 to 10

battery life is better than my ancient phone.
wifi6 is fast, about 300Mbps tested
Wifi6 Stats:
Channel 40 (11ax)
Signal 94% (-53 dBm)
Rx Rate 960 Mbps
Tx Rate 648 Mbps
Power Save Enabled

5G is decent (LTE+ indicated at 100Mbps down, 4Mbps up, AT&T in Raleigh, NC)

If you you like Samsung's spin on android and large screens this is a great phone for you.

Great phone, marred by some pretty big issues.
Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2020
Style: S20 FEColor: Cloud NavySize: 128GBVerified Purchase
I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.

At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I've done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You'll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can't beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.

But, if you've been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I'd say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn't, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it's not flagship levels by any stretch. You'll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you're looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I'd look elsewhere.

From what I've seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There's undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I'm sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven't noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that's about all I've seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don't blame you.

It really is a shame that I can't give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there's always the worry that time will make them worse. It's a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I'm more than happy with it.

Edit (8/18/2021): I've dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.

It's been a little less than a year, and the issues mentioned above have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay, maybe not daily use, per se. But enough that it's starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.

The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket, it's opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen, as suspected. This is a pure hardware messup.

Here's the cold, honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone's screen. It's beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic "angry Amazon customer 1-star" review, but I'll refrain. There's still good here with the chip, customizability, and great battery life, but that stuff can only get you so far.

Here's my advice: don't bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price, with better specs. It's still not the worst thing out there and I'm not tossing it in the trash just yet, but it's definitely the last Samsung product I'll be buying. So disappointing, but I couldn't keep this review a 4-star in good conscience.

Bait & Switch?
Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2020
Style: S20 FEColor: Cloud NavySize: 128GBVerified Purchase
When I purchased this it was listed as 8gb of ram but the model I received is 6gb. That makes me feel lured into something I wasn't expecting.

The phone is a solid overall phone with premium performance for the price due to sacrificing the build quality by making the back plastic and the screen gorilla glass 3 instead of 6.

Doesn't matter to me as I wanted an unused device (battery) with a top notch processor for the smallest price point.

I'm still slightly upset about not getting 8gb as was listed when I purchased which is why I didn't rate 5/5.

Touch screen ghost inputs
Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2020
Style: S20 FEColor: Cloud NavySize: 128GBVerified Purchase
 This was the perfect phone until I started wondering what was wrong with my screen. Your touchs will be misread causing random inputs and jitter. This is a recording of how the phone is recognizing my inputs when using two fingers in alternating succession as well as when swiping with two fingers. This effects everyday use in subtle but frustrating ways. From taps being read as scrolling to unplayable multitouch games, the screen makes me miss my 3 year old galaxy S8. The most recent software update to fix the issue has made no difference. If you buy this phone it WILL have this problem. I was originally in the group that assumed mine wasn't affected, but it became hard to ignore the signs after a week.

Sorry, Not Sorry
Great phone at a great price
Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2020
Style: S20 FEColor: Cloud NavySize: 128GB
Just got this yesterday, the day it came out. I got the Navy Blue, which looks great. I got it to replace my 1st generation Pixel XL. Because the Pixel's battery was old Google stopped supporting security updates, I decided to upgrade. I thought about a Pixel 4a, but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen, huge battery, and top-of-the-line processor for $600, that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what's in the Pixel line, it's not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.

The only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn't as good, and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost, but I feel that the Pixel software doesn't add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not. If anything else, it should have decent trade-in value in a year or two.

Muy buen telefono
Reviewed in Mexico on December 2, 2020
Style: S20 FEColor: Cloud NavySize: 128GBVerified Purchase
Tengo prácticamente una semana con el equipo y no me arrepiento de nada, vengo de un galaxy s8+ y el salto es muy bueno, quería un s20+ pero después de tantos videos de análisis que ví me decidí por este s20 fe ya que no le pide nada al plus, solo el tema de que la parte de atrás es de plástico pero seamos sinceros la mayoría lo ocupará con funda así que estarás poco en contacto con esa parte. Voy por partes:

Tiene: carga inalámbrica, carga reversible, snapdragon 865, resistente al agua y polvo, 6 de ram, 128 de almacenamiento, tasa de refresco 120, pantalla Amoled, batería 4500 mha, Cargador "mexicano" pero de 15w yo te recomiendo que compres uno de 25w cuando hagas tu pedido para que tengas carga súper rápida ya que es lo que admite el teléfono, la entrada es USB c, trae pinchito, admite tarjeta SD, solo un SIM, si se puede usar en México sin problema yo lo ocupo con Telcel sin problema.

No tiene: pantalla curva que en mi caso agradezco ya que algunas áreas en las pantallas curvas son difíciles de alcanzar, me pasaba mucho con mi s8+, no trae funda por lo que recomiendo que compres una al mismo tiempo que hagas tu pedido del celular para que cuando te llegue tu equipo puedas usarlo con su funda y estés más seguro 😊. No tiene entrada de audífonos 3.5 por lo que si no tienes audifonos Bluetooth vayas pensando en comprar uno o comprar un adaptador, para mí no es ningún problema ya que los audífonos no los ocupo casi.

Envío: me tardo en llegar una semana prácticamente pero todo dentro de los días que me marcó desde el inicio la fecha de llegada, pudo haber llegado antes pero en mi caso DHL no llega directo a mi ciudad si no que hace reconexión, pero todo eso está contemplado en la fecha de llegada así que todo bien. La caja llegó en buenas condiciones y toda sellada nada abierta solo un poquito arrugadita de una esquina pero se entiende por el manejo de la mensajería, nada agrave prácticamente imperceptible.

Pago: pague lo que marca el precio en el anuncio, no tuve que pagar nada más ya que parece que los gastos de manejo vienen incluído en el precio anunciado, en México sin ser 5g y sin el procesador snapdragon el teléfono está en unos 16 mil y lo que pague que fueron $13,200 es un súper precio considerando que es 5g y trae el snapdragon.

Rendimiento: lo he usado con los 120 hzs y me ha durado todo el día la batería, llegó con un 20% a las 9 pm. Creo que es un rendimiento bueno pero no el mejor considerando que juego prácticamente nada al día, mi mayor uso son las redes sociales, correo y aplicaciones del trabajo pero las ocupo mucho que compensa esa parte del juego así que no creo tengas problema para terminar tu día con algo de batería y si no una cargadita de 20 minutos y listo. El rendimiento ha sido de unas 7.5 horas de pantalla encendida.

Cámaras: si considero que venía de un s8+ el salto ha sido muy grande, las cámaras tienen muy buena calidad y nada que envidiar al s20+ si no me crees ve los videos de reseñas y verás que no hay mucha diferencia por lo mucho más que pagas en el plus creo que el FE tiene mejor calidad precio.

En resumen es un buen telefono, me gusta mucho el módulo de cámaras, el color que elegí fue el azul y me agradó mucho, se siente como un premium y luce como un premium, yo pensaba en darle una oportunidad a un Xiaomi, realme, poco etc pero seamos sinceros Samsung es Samsung y si trae un snapdragon es mucho mejor, estoy seguro que los Specs suenan fabulosos en otras marcas pero no creo que su calidad de equipo aguante el pasar de los años, yo uso los teléfonos un promedio de 3 años, siempre Samsung y los he dejado prácticamente como nuevos. Así que si quieres un teléfono bueno, bonito y que te dure unos años este es tu opción ideal, no te vas arrepentir.

Casi perfecto y excelente. Lo volvería a comprar.
Reviewed in Mexico on January 9, 2021
Style: S20 FEColor: Cloud NavySize: 128GBVerified Purchase
 El teléfono llegó super rápido y lo compré por un excelente precio $13,500 más o menos.

La pantalla es muy buena y no le pide nada a los otros modelos s20. En tanto a la pantalla lo único que me ha pasado es que un par de veces después de desbloquearlo no reconoce mis gestos o cuando toco la pantalla en algunas partes, desconozco el por qué. Fuera de eso me funciona de maravilla la respuesta tanto que juego COD mobile.

El sonido es muy bueno porque tiene un par de bocinas con sonido estéreo que te hacen tener una gran experiencia al consumir contenido multimedia.

Los métodos de seguridad funcionan bien, nada del otro mundo pero bien. Sigo prefiriendo el lector de huella físico que el que tiene integrado pero tarda un par de segundos en responder. El desbloqueo facial es bueno pero podría ser mejor.

Las cámaras soy muy buenas y puedes grabar a 60 fps en 4k, en esta configuración no tiene estabilización pero para una toma estática va de maravilla. La cámara frontal es muy buena y reconoce el rostro para saber si tiene que ampliar la toma en dado caso que detecte dos rostros.

La batería, 45000 mAh dan super bien para un día de uso empezando desde las 8 AM hasta al rededor de las 10 de la noche cuando ya estás en casa y lo puedes comenzar a cargar. El cargador que viene de fábrica en mi caso fue el tipo americano de 15w y carga suficientemente rápido. Lo anterior con la pantalla a 60 Hz. No he podido probar la pantalla un día completo o una carga completa en 120 Hz.

El rendimiento es bueno, 6 gb de ram son buenos aunque con 8 sería perfecto. Aún así el snapdragon hace un gran trabajo en el rendimiento, no se traba jugando o navegando, no se calienta por el uso, claro siempre y cuando le des un uso normal.

Los contras que le encuentro al teléfono es que sí extraño el Jack de 3.5 mm para los auriculares, tengo que ocupar unos Bluetooth que tengo. Es difícil encontrar accesorios cheveres y una mica específica para la pantalla porque aún es un teléfono relativamente nuevo. Quiero resaltar que aun con una mica de cristal templado lee bien mi huella pero el cristal que conseguí no le quedó a la perfección aún así el chiste es que lo proteja.

Los pros o puntos a favor son demasiados por todo el extra que ofrece además de las cosas buenas que ya mencione. Samsung te ofrece grandes cosas como la carga reversible e inalambrica, filtro de luz azul (es buenísimo para la vista y lo recomiendo), conexión a Windows (tiene alianza con Windows haciendo que sea muy fácil vincular el teléfono con un equipo de computo Windows y poder recibir notificaciones, hacer llamadas, transmitir la pantalla del teléfono en la computadora, etc), Dex (vuelve tu teléfono como una laptop), puedes grabar la pantalla del teléfono directamente desde los accesos directos y la barra edge deslizando desde un costado de la pantalla, también se ilumina el borde de la pantalla con las notificaciones que configures entre muchas cosas más. Es una gran opción y lo recomiendo.

Es la versión 5G de USA

Style: S20 FEColor: Cloud RedSize: 128GBVerified Purchase
Lo compré cuando aparecía a la venta con Samsung USA, la verdad estoy complacido, ya que el color era el que quería y se siente tan bien. Además ésta versión era la versión 5G lo cuál me deja aún más contento, sé que en México aún no tenemos red 5G pero al menos estar preparado para cuando ocurra es lo ideal.
Lamento mucho que Samsung México no lo venda en versión 5G.

La duda de muchos es si funciona con las redes de México y la respuesta es sí, viene desbloqueado de fábrica y a mi me funciona muy bien, tengo un chip de Telcel.

Si estas pensando en comprar este equipo definitivamente debes adquirirlo en Amazon, aparte de ser más barato, es la versión americana con procesador Qualcomm Snapdragon que a comparación con el Exynos de la versión internacional ofrece más bateria y mejor rendimiento
