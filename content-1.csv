Slow and Frustrating
Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2020
Color: Mystic WhiteSize: 128GBStyle: Note 20 Ultra 5GPattern Name: Cell PhoneVerified Purchase
To preface this, I am being forced to purchase a new device as all US networks are apparently no longer supporting Huawei devices in the very near future. I decided to give the Note a try as it seemed that it would keep up with my daily usage for work and I've always desired having the S pen.

I've been using this phone for a few days now and it is soooooo slow. Apps and Google searches take way too long to load. Hotspot is just downright awful. Battery life is sub par. Fast charging is much slower than what I had. Camera doesn't quite compare to my old phone's Leica camera, which I figured it wouldn't. Not sure what kind of scam this is but I'm definitely returning it. Also didn't come with earbuds or the phone clone connector. Don't get me wrong, the phone looks great. The S pen was everything I was hoping for. The screen is spectacular and super bright. The 120hz refresh rate was cool for maybe the first 10 sec, then I realized it was a pretty worthless feature. Scrolling to the end of long page in a few seconds does me no good when I'm trying to read posts or search for information on that page.

I went to AT&T to get my phone diagnosed. He tested it against his Note 20 Ultra and his phone ended up being twice as fast as mine running the same speed test, on the same network, on the same unlimited plan... all after my device took an additional 10-15 sec to connect before even starting the test.

My advice, don't waste your money. Just because Samsung markets like crazy doesn't mean their phones are any good. For a flagship device and the price point, this phone falls well short of being worth it. I came from a two year old Huawei Mate 20 Pro and it's sad that Samsung can't make a phone that is able to compete with it. Not what I expected for my first Note phone. I've never been a Samsung hater by any means, but this experience just solidifies my previous viewpoint to never buy a Samsung device. Won't make that mistake again.

Update:
I made that mistake again... In my defense, I was hoping this was an isolated incident or just a simple case of a bad device. I ordered another unlocked Note 20 Ultra from Best Busy to compare. Unfortunately for me, it was not. That device had all the same issues. Slow network speeds with AT&T (I live in a major city so this shouldn't happen, period). This phone also didn't come with earbuds so it seems like Samsung is just getting cheap on consumers.

I tried swapping the SIM card with my girlfriend's S20 and it still didn't work. All calls were sent directly to voicemail and text messages were very hit or miss. AT&T had no idea, but I'm sure it was out of the hourly employees realm to troubleshoot. I had to switch back to my Huawei Mate 20 Pro. After 10 min or so I got a couple delayed text messages that were sent days ago in response to a text I originally sent from the Note 20 Ultra. SMH...

I'm just downright confused at this point. Not sure whether it's an issue with the device or with the 5G network, or both. You also can't change which network bands you want to use, ie. turn 5G off. You can only toggle 2G on and off. My buddy has full control with his Note 10+ which is really mind boggling. Either way, both phones have been returned.

I'm self-employed and my phone is my lifeline. I don't have time to play these games or wait for Samsung to release an update. Such a shame because I really wanted to like this phone and I loved the S pen so far. Samsung just has a history of not being able to meet my expectations. The even bigger shame is that I can't upgrade to better Huawei device...

The best Phone that money can buy
Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2020
Color: Mystic BlackSize: 128GBStyle: Note 20 Ultra 5GPattern Name: Cell PhoneVerified Purchase
The cameras, the S-pen, the AMOLED screen quality, the 120 Hz refresh rate, the 5G data connection, the build quality, etc. are all top notch. This phone will probably hold the crown for best Android phone for a good while, and it has key feature bumps that made me especially want this phone--namely the 5G and the 120 Hz screen.

I would definitely recommend a solid case if you're planning to spend this much money on a phone. I bought a Spigen case which effectively reduces the camera bump on the back to allow the phone to sit flat on a desk. The IP68 rating means that it will be fine with water and dust, but drop protection is still a must. I saw a stat recently that something like 2/3 of people report incurring drop damage to their phone (for all phones not specifically this phone).

Other thoughts: I think it's interesting that most middle class people can afford the best phone that you can possibly purchase for a product that is in your pocket, everyday, all the time. You can't say that about cars, houses, clothes, but you could definitely swing buying the best phone that money can buy once every 3-4 years if it's important enough to you. For me it is, and I'm very happy with this phone.

Lastly: Google Pixel, 1+, Apple, etc. can only hope to match some of the features that this phone has to offer, but I highly doubt that they will exceed this phone's specs on yet to be release products. Just my opinion as a phone guy, but the best that they could hope to do is give you a better value on specific features. If you're somebody looking for the best value on a calling and texting machine, then this phone is not for you. This phone is for somebody that wants the best cameras, pocket computing power, & screen quality that money can buy you right now.

Why 1 star? it poses a risk for owners exposing until 20 TIMES more EMF radiation than Note 9
Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2020
Color: Mystic WhiteSize: 128GBStyle: Note 20 Ultra 5GPattern Name: Cell PhoneVerified Purchase
I'm a Samsung fan, design and productivity is amazing and perfect, BUT it have a no-go for me: it poses a risk for phone owners. Using a EMF detector it registered 10 to 20 times more electromagnetic exposure than older note 9. Even using it with WIFI, exposure was increased dramatically, initially thought it was due 5G but even Wifi increase risk many times, and with 5G, it holds a huge risk for phone owners. Imagine add to this radiation device, add wireless earbuds... it's a no brainer to avoid this ... Because I love me, I avoid this.... Read between lines what chaos it'll create on your health or your loved ones

I'm upgrading from a US (at & t) note 10+
I play a silly game with not much with graphics, but I did notice a huge stutter at some points. Then just browsing and scrolling pages it is not smooth when you go slow. After all that I ran geekbench AND SCORED TERRIBLE!!!! WTH.... I'll try some different things and update if needed. ..
